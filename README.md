## Instructions

> The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

> To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
This a fork from [udacity front end projects](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page).

In this project I implemented in pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript the following features:
1. dynamic navbar
2. dynamic highlighting for the active nav element
3. smooth scrolling
4. scroll to top button
5. hide fixed navbar while reading (not scrolling)
6. simple animations

I hope you find this project useful, feel free to fork or pull request it
